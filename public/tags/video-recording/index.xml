&lt;p&gt;As I was on the lookout for a software that I can do a screen recording, i came across Open Broadcaster Software (OBS). It was quite interesting that during my initial recording trial I can’t seem to capture my screen on video. After a few minutes of puzzlement and frustration, I am ready to give up on OBS as I can’t seem to record my screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I later found out that there is a &lt;em&gt;black screen issue during screen capture&lt;/em&gt; lingering in the google results pages. After a few articles and videos scanned, this was the video that sealed that deal. What at first turned out to be a difficult software to work on, I now realize why OBS is one of the most popular software out there for this kind of job, post &lt;em&gt;black screen&lt;/em&gt; era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNSjGve-Zn1t4CLXAtL3jeQ/about&#34;&gt;thyQuis&lt;/a&gt; for this helpful video.&lt;/p&gt;
