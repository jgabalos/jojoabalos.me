  ###### Semiconductor Manufacturing and Test Program Development Experience
  
  
  Worked on test program development on logic IC's (Integrated Circuits - chipset products and network processors), including product start-up in Assembly/Test Manufacturing sites. Has gained very good knowledge in semiconductor manufacturing, assembly and test operations, product testing and test program development by handling several product generations of Chipsets and Network Processor devices over the past 10 years.
  
  
  ######  Process Improvement Through Statistical Skills
  
  
  As a Product Engineer for operations, has handled key product indicators (yield, quality, retest/recovery, statistical bin limits, cost improvement) and has driven task forces and work teams to meet and exceed goals through different projects. Has very strong statistics background and use of statistics software such as JMP, to perform commonality analysis, root cause identification and problem solving techniques.


  ######  Project Management and Leadership
  
  
  Aside from test program development and product start-ups, has also handled different projects and programs related to product sustaining and maintenance of business including yield improvement, CPU (cost per unit) reduction, DPM (Defect per million) reduction, quality issue resolutions, engineering competency development and technical leadership program. With the different products supported, was able to consistently meet the different quality and product health goals, and managed different excursions and product issues in manufacturing proactively to ensure quality and product delivery.


  ######  Technical Proficiency and Being Self-Driven


  As a test program developer, very knowledgeable in ATE (Automated Test Equipment) hardware and programming software. Proficient in different logic test methods including the basic parametric testing, functional testing, scan testing and DFT’s (Design for Testability). Also, has vast experience in test program debug, silicon debug, unit level device characterization, and TIU (Test Interface Unit) design and validation.
  
  Armed with technical background and self-driven soft skill, was able to easily learn and migrate learnings to other ATE’s as displayed this during involvement in the pioneering project on CMT (Configurable Modular Tester) migration. With no formal training on CMT and through self-taught learnings, was able to deliver and successfully owned test program integration and test bring-up in such a short time. The team was able to do the conversion in a record 4 months.
 

  ######  Working Across International Borders


  Had a very good exposure in working with teams across different countries and cultures, as the current work entails team collaboration with US, Europe and Asia spanning different organizations including Design, Technology Development, Fabrication & Sort, and Subcontractors.

  Has also been deployed in several international work assignments to do Product Test Development in US and Malaysia and be exposed to different work styles and cultures.


  ######  Technical Trainer and Competency Development Champion

  Has conducted several technical trainings from time to time for Product Engineers on various topics including Test Program Development, Statistical Analysis, and Product Orientations for management and the factory. Also, was a certified trainer by Intel University Administration (IUA) on Equipment Safety.
  
  Furthermore, has handled the department’s portfolio on competency development in partnership with Training department to accelerate the technical and soft skills of Product Engineers.


  ######  Technical Paper Authorship Driver

 Authored several technical papers accepted in both local and international conferences as follows. Furthermore, has been the key driver in the Product Engineering department to encourage and make technical writing a way of life in the organization. Conducted several trainings on Abstract and Technical writing classes to help in the harvesting, and through the whole department’s efforts, the team is now recognized by different corporate technical conferences through its contributions.  
 
 
  ######  Technical Papers Authored
  
  Aside from being the technical paper driver, has also authored several papers and were presented in both local and international symposia:
  
  ▪ “Test Socket Performance Equivalence -- A Challenge in High Speed Interface Testing in Parallel Mode” -- Oral Presentation for Intel Manufacturing Excellence Conference (IMEC) 2006 in San Diego, CA
  
  ▪ “CMT Conversion Learnings and Best-known Methods (BKMs)” – Oral Presentation in Product Development Engineering Learning and Networking Forum in Hillsboro, OR in 2005
  
  ▪ “Characterizing Quad Data Rate (QDR) Interface Leakage in IXP2400” -- Oral Presentation in Association of Semiconductor and Manufacturing Engineers of the Philippines (ASEMEP) last 2004 held in Manila, Philippines.
  
  ▪ “An Alternative Approach of Determining Process Sensitivities Through Statistical Fit Modelling” -- Journal for Intel Philippines Technical Symposium (IPTS) in Cavite, Philippines last 2007.
