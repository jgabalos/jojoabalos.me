<p>As I was on the lookout for a software that I can do a screen recording, i came across Open Broadcaster Software (OBS). It was quite interesting that during my initial recording trial I can’t seem to capture my screen on video. After a few minutes of puzzlement and frustration, I am ready to give up on OBS as I can’t seem to record my screen.</p>
<p>I later found out that there is a <em>black screen issue during screen capture</em> lingering in the google results pages. After a few articles and videos scanned, this was the video that sealed that deal. What at first turned out to be a difficult software to work on, I now realize why OBS is one of the most popular software out there for this kind of job, post <em>black screen</em> era.</p>
